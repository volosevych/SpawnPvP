                You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including
                our subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of our respective
                officers, agents, partners, and employees, from and against any
                loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable
                attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or
                arising out of: (1) use of the Services; (2) breach of these
                Legal Terms; (3) any breach of your representations and

                toward any other user of the Services with whom you connected
                via the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the
                right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and
                control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify
                us, and you agree to cooperate, at your expense, with our
                defense of such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify
                you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to
                this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.

              <p>
                These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by
                us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the
                entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent
                permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
                or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused
                by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
                part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be
                unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
                provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does
                not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
                provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment
                or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of
                these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these
                Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having
                drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have
                based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack
                of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
